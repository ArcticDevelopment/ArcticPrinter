# All items already have to be in shop,
# but some items like buckets will be in
# the shop but should be disabled in printer.

# Reference the bukkit docs below to ensure that you get
# the right material, and double check (materials are confusing)
# Ex: REDSTONE (item form), REDSTONE_WIRE (block form)
# Disabling REDSTONE would disable getting redstone, while
# disabling REDSTONE_WIRE would disable placing redstone
